Machine learning project to make a product recommendation system and predict fashion product sales next month




Product Details: The dataset captures four main fashion products under the "Bold Boxy" series — Dress, Set, Shoes, and Tee — along with their respective catalog and cost prices. This allows for analysis of pricing strategies and profit margins.

Color Distribution: Product color preferences are recorded, showing a nearly balanced demand across popular colors such as Black, Blue, Green, Red, and White. Black ranks highest with 104 items sold, indicating strong consumer preference.

Size Variants: Product sizing includes at least size 35 and 36 (as shown in the filters), giving flexibility for market segmentation based on physical fit and regional size demand.

Sales Channels: Two primary sales channels — E-commerce and Mobile App — are compared. E-commerce generated the highest total original price (57K), slightly above the Mobile App channel (54K), reflecting strong performance in digital shopping platforms.

Customer Demographics: The dataset categorizes customers by age ranges (16–25, 26–35, 36–45, 46–55, 56–65) and country (France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain). This segmentation is useful for targeted marketing and personalized service strategies.

Customer Service Trends: A year-over-year breakdown of customer service interactions per age group and country is visualized. For instance, in 2025, the 36–45 age group from France reported the highest service interaction (37), suggesting that middle-aged customers may require more support or are more engaged.

Overall Product Count: A total of 500 fashion items are included, showcasing product volume and sales scope.
