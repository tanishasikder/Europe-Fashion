handling the code. making sure its good

    feature selection by seeing how much each feature contributes
    to the the prediction like permutation importance

    normalization

    feature creation: making new features from existing ones

    missing values by dropping or replacing with median

    one hot encoding train test and label encoding test set 

    binning if needed

    handling outliers by the interquartile range

    smote/adasyn for minority class

    argument class_weight = 'balanced'

    drop rare classes

    pipeline

    evaluate every input variable and see if its relevant/
    something the model would know during predict 

    classification report to see which classes are being ignored

    compute_class_weight to help imbalance

    hyperparameter tuning and grid search

    cross validation on training set
